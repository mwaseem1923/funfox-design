      <p className="">
        Welcome to term 2 of Writers Club. Are you excited for this amazing
        journey?
        <br />
        Over the next week, we will be practicing the different elements of

          There are five elements which make the foundation for story writing.
          An element is an essential part of something and every fiction story
          has the same key elements :

      </div>
      <ul className="key-elements-list">
        <li className="setting">SETTING</li>
        <li className="characters">CHARACTERS</li>
        <li className="plot">PLOT</li>
        <li className="problem">PROBLEM OR CONFLICT</li>
        <li className="resolution">RESOLUTION</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="">
        You must be familiar with some of these. If not, do not worry! We will
        cover all these elements as we go along.

        For today's lesson, we will try to understand and practice writing the
        setting for our stories.
        <br />
        The setting is an important element of every fiction story.
